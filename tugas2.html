                <h2>Wake Up, Girls!</h2>
                <p>
                    I have always loved this seiyuu actress unit called Wake Up, Girls! They were originated from Sendai and had been around for around 6 years. The reason why I was so adamant to go to Japan was so I had the chance to see them before they disbanded. I was so happy when I finally was able to make my dream came true and I could go to their concerts in Japan when I was 17!

                <h2>First step on Japan!</h2>
                <p>
                    In 2018, right after I turned 17 I immediately went to register my passport. Seconds after I got my passport, I then applied for a Japan visa so I would have the permit to enter the country. At that time, I already saved up enough money to get myself a two way round ticket to Tokyo, Japan. Lots of funny and memorable things happened during the trip so I'd love if you want to read the blog!

                <h2>I am so glad I became a fan of WUG</h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first blog that I wrote in Japanese! Because of this blog I have got to know so many great people. We as a group of friend had a lot in common so it was very easy to find topics to talk! I wrote this blog to show my love and boast how this group have impacted my life to the point that it changed my personality for the better and made me a more complete and caring human being.
